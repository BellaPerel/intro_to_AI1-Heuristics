Task Summary:
In this task, you are tasked with solving a taxi problem in a grid world using search algorithms. The goal is to efficiently deliver passengers to their destinations while managing fuel and capacity constraints. The task involves modeling the problem, defining actions for taxis, and implementing search algorithms to find optimal solutions.

What We Did:
1. We understood the problem's environment, rules, and goals.
2. Designed a Python class called `TaxiProblem` to represent and solve the problem.
3. Implemented functions for generating available actions, calculating the next state, checking goal conditions, and defining heuristic functions.
4. Heuristic functions, `h_1` and `h_2`, were implemented to help guide the search process.
5. Utilized search algorithms like A* to find optimal solutions.
6. The goal is to deliver all passengers to their destinations in the fewest turns while considering fuel constraints and passenger capacity.
